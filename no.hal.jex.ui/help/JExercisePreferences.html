<h2>JExercise preferences</h2>

The JExercise view lets the user select and view one of a set of exercises, represented by XML files with the .jex file extension.
To find these .jex files, JExercise must know where to look for them, i.e. the path, and
the filename pattern which is used to generate or filter the names.
Both the path and this pattern must be set in the preferences, which are found in the Window->Preferences...->JExercise section.

<dl compact="true">
<dt>Server<dd>This preference is currently unused, but may later point to the location of the exercises on a course server.
<dt>File path<dd>This preference is the path to the folder where the .jex files reside.
The path is relative to the workspace, must start with a "/" and should contain at least a project name.
If your exercises are in the project named programming-course and the .jex files are at the top level within this project,
the path should be /programming-course/. If the .jex files are located in the exercises folder, the path should be /programming-course/exercises/.
<dt>File pattern<dd>When JExercise needs to locate the .jex files, it uses two different strategies, depending on the
file pattern preference. If the file pattern contains "{0}" (zero within braces)
it generates a sequence of filenames from the pattern and a counter. The filenames are the result of using the pattern
as a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html">MessageFormat</a>
with the counter as the argument.
E.g. if the .jex files are named ex1.jex, ex2.jex, ex3.jex and so forth, the "ex{0}.jex" file pattern could be used.
If the file pattern does no contain "{0}", it is interpreted as a
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Pattern</a> and used to filter
the files found in the project or folder denoted by the file path.
E.g. if the .jex files are named ex1.jex, ex2.jex, ex3.jex and so forth, the "ex\d+.jex" file pattern could be used.
To use all .jex files, ".*\.jex" is sufficient.

When the preferences changes, the list of exercises (in the combo box) will be refreshed.
